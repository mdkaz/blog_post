# Frameworks/Technologies

- ReactJS: ReactJS is a popular Javascript framework for frontend development. I chose ReactJS as opposed to Vue or Angular because I prefer the organization of components. Components will allow me to easily modularize the design of this webpage so that it is highly configurable.

- JDBC: I am more familiar with JDBC as opposed to other frameworks such as Hibernate. JDBC is more practical for simpler databases such as storing user comments for this blog post.

- Database with PostreSQL: I am more familiar with using psql, though psql or mysql would also be suitable for this project.

# Outline

### Frontend:

- File Structure:

  - Assets: Resource files that are imported by header, and content section
  - Components: Small visual or functional pieces imported by containers or other larger components
  - Containers: Large grouping of components that serve a larger function
  - Style: files needed to visually arrange and style the blog post.

- Divide up the page into 3 main sections:
  - Header
  - Content
  - Comments
- Divide each
