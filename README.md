# Frameworks/Technologies

-ReactJS: ReactJS is a popular Javascript framework for frontend development. I chose ReactJS as opposed to Vue or Angular because I prefer the organization of components. Components will allow me to easily modularize the design of this webpage so that it is highly configurable.
-JDBC: I am more familiar with JDBC as opposed to other frameworks such as Hibernate. JDBC is more practical for simpler databases such as storing user comments for this blog post.
